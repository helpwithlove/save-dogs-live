                My Dog(Kim) is sick and needs surgery

            <p>
                It is two months that my dog(Kim) is very sick and needs surgery. For the love of God help him stay
                alive. He is my best friend ever!. If you don't help him, he will die soon and I will miss him so bad.

                Thank you for your help
            </h1>
            <p>
                I asked all of my friends to help me with this horrible situation but unfortunately most of them do not
                have enough money for themselves and some of them are not so friendly with animals so the only solution
                was that I had to come to you and now I appreciate your help. You save my dog's life. Thank you very
                much and God bless you. Take care and much love!
            </p>
